The **Jumio service** is responsible for supporting the userÂ´s identity verification, their address information extraction from the uploaded files which is provided by external partner Jumio. 

The [Jumio](https://github.com/Jumio/implementation-guides) frameworks are:

* **Netverify** for proof of identity and data extraction
* **Document verification** for proof of address and data extraction

## Responsibilities of the service

The ultimate responsilibity of the service is to capture identity and address documentation from the user.

It does this by supporting:
* **Document upload** from the user e.g. identity and address documents and
* **Document validation** of those documents

**Document verification** and **Data extraction** on the uploads is performed directly by the [Jumio external service](https://www.jumio.com/id-verification/).

## How to use the service

The Jumio service is kicked off by the [onboarding process](mw-gen-user-activation-ib.md) when a `CUSTOM` step with the `stepCode` `JUMIO` or `JUMIO_POA` is encountered. See the [Onboarding - private API](mw-gen-user-activation-ib/user-activation-private-ib/latest) documentation for more details.

The entire workflow of processing a document or verification is called a **scan transaction**.

The following **scan transactions** can be requested:
* **Proof of identity (POI)** where the customer will upload identity documents (e.g. passport, driver's license) and take a selfie
* **Proof of address (POA)** where the customer will upload address documents (e.g. bank statements, utility bills)

When the upload is completed, Jumio external service will perform these activities on background, Consument application does not wait for them to be completed and continue with parent flow.
1. **Extract data** from the files
2. **Perform checks** against the data and documents uploaded
3. **Send results to the Leveris Server**

The API flow for each type of scan transaction is the same, however, the base URLs change slightly:
  * **Proof of identity (POI)**: `api/private/jumio/poi/` eg: `api/private/jumio/poi/!getScanTransactionStatus`
  * **Proof of address (POA)**:  `api/private/jumio/poa/` eg: `api/private/jumio/poa/!getScanTransactionStatus`

However, the API flow varies depending on the channel: **web** or **mobile**.

 ### Handling the mobile channel

1. Call `/!getScanTransactionStatus` to find out whether the transaction is `NOT_STARTED_YET`, `PENDING` or `SUCCESS`. If the transaction is either `NOT_STARTED_YET` or `PENDING` continue to step 2. If `SUCCESS`, continue the parent flow

2. Start the scan transaction by calling `/!startScanTransaction`. This returns the data required to configure the Jumio mobile frameworks. This includes the **callback URL** which facilitates the communication between the Leveris and Jumio servers

3. Open the mobile framework. Depending on the type of **scan transaction**, you will use either:
   - **Netverify** for proof of identity (see [iOS](https://github.com/Jumio/mobile-sdk-ios/blob/master/docs/integration_netverify-fastfill.md) and [Android](https://github.com/Jumio/mobile-sdk-android/blob/master/docs/integration_netverify-fastfill.md)) or
   - **Document verification** for proof of address (see [iOS](https://github.com/Jumio/mobile-sdk-ios/blob/master/docs/integration_document-verification.md) and [Android](https://github.com/Jumio/mobile-sdk-android/blob/master/docs/integration_document-verification.md))

When the framework has finished, the app will get a `scanReference` that must be sent to the server.

4. Call `/!setScanTransaction` to send the `scanReference`

5. Call `/!setScanTransactionStatus` to set the resulting `status` of the process

6. Continue the parent flow

### Handling the web channel

1. Call `/!getScanTransactionStatus` to find out whether the transaction is `NOT_STARTED_YET` or `SUCCESS`. If the transaction is either `NOT_STARTED_YET` continue to step 2. If `SUCCESS`, continue the parent flow

2. Get the framework url to start the upload. Depending on the type of the scan transaction, you will use either `/!initiate` (proof of identity) or `/!acquisitions` (proof of address). Add the `successUrl` and `errorUrl` to the body of the request. The call returns the `redirectUrl`

3. Call the `redirectUrl` to open the required Jumio framework. When complete, the framework will redirect to one of previously specified URLs: `successUrl` or `errorUrl`

4. Send the `status` with `/!setScanTransactionStatus`

5. Return to the parent flow
